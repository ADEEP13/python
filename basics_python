-->The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other
 high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, Pascal, C#, and Java.

-->As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as
 machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low
level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be translated into something more suitable
 before they can run.
